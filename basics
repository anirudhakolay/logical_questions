# Rhea Pandey's teacher has asked her to prepare well for the lesson on seasons. When her teacher tells a month, she needs to say the season corresponding to that month.
Write a program to solve the above task.
Spring - March to May, Summer - June to August, Autumn - September to November and, Winter - December to February. Month should be in the range 1 to 12. If not the output should be "Invalid month".

Sample Input 1: Enter the month:11
Sample Output 1: Season: Autumn
Sample Input 2: Enter the month:13
Sample Output 2: Invalid month
# Program to determine the season based on month

month = int(input("Enter the month: "))

if month < 1 or month > 12:
    print("Invalid month")
elif month >= 3 and month <= 5:
    print("Season: Spring")
elif month >= 6 and month <= 8:
    print("Season: Summer")
elif month >= 9 and month <= 11:
    print("Season: Autumn")
else:  # months 12, 1, 2
    print("Season: Winter")
