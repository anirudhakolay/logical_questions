#Imagine you are working as an intern at a music streaming company. Your boss wants to create a new 'Loop Mode' feature. When a user creates a playlist, the system needs to automatically generate a queue that plays the entire playlist once, and then immediately plays the exact same playlist again from the start. Write a program that takes any list of songs (represented by ID numbers) and returns a new list that plays the sequence twice back-to-back. in python

def loop_mode(playlist):
    """
    Generates a queue that plays the playlist twice back-to-back.

    Parameters:
    playlist (list): A list of song IDs (integers or strings).

    Returns:
    list: A new list with the playlist repeated twice.
    """
    return playlist + playlist


# Example usage:
playlist = [101, 102, 103, 104]   # Song IDs
queue = loop_mode(playlist)
print("Original Playlist:", playlist)
print("Loop Mode Queue:", queue)
